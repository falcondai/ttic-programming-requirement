# TODO

## implementation
- change arg parser to partial parse
- implement eval script
- implement continuous action models
- add tuple type for state
- adversarial games

## experiments
- FF and RNN on simple gym classic env's
- test on multi-GPU machines
- FF slower than RNN?
- try motion blur with RNN
