# TODO

## implementation
- eligibility traces
- implement continuous action models
- add tuple type for state (gym has StateTuple)
- human agent (needs to be env-specific, doom -> spectator mode, atari -> WASD, etc)
- algorithmic envs
- clean up and integrate the old RL algo impl

## envs
- start multiple baxter-gazebo?
- multi-arm bandit
- mujoco
- discrete ob space games (maze)
- mnist glimpse
- mnist/cifar-10 compression
- rubik's cube
- adversarial games

## experiments
- gym classic env's with FF and RNN
- test on multi-GPU machines
